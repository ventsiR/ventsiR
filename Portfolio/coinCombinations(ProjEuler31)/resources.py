There are eight coins in general circulation:\n\n\t1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).\n\nIt is possible to make £2 in the following way:\n\n\t1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p\n\nHow many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n--------------------------------------\nThis program answers this question for any target and collection of coins of unique value you input.\n--------------------------------------\n\n\n--------------------------------------\nInput info: enter the target value you want your coins to sum to as an integer in the unit of money such that the value of your least valuable coin in the same unit is also an integer.\nFor the above example, I would enter '200'. If I wanted to also consider a coin worth 0.2p, then I could enter 2000 for my target, in which case I would enter 2 for my 0.2p coin, 10 for a 1p coin and so on.\n\nEnter your target:"
