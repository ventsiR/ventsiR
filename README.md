Iâ€™m Ventsi Radev; a 24 y/o aspiring dev, based in New York City.

I am coming up on 2 years of experience in driving & delivering projects at Stanley Black & Decker and have a Masters in Mathematics. I am experienced with Python and SQL, as well as mainstay business services like Power BI, Alteryx & Power Automate.
