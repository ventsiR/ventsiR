# About me

My name is Ventsi Radev, I am based in the US and am aspiring towards a career in software engineering.

I graduated from Lancaster University with a Masters in Mathematics in 2021, and over the past 2 years I have consistently driven & delivered projects at Stanley Black & Decker. I am experienced with Python and SQL, as well as mainstay business services like Alteryx, Snowflake, Power BI & Power Automate.

Currently I'm learning C to strengthen my low-level programming fundamentals and improving my RegEx.
