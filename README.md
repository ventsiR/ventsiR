# About me

My name is Ventsi Radev. I am based in the US and open to any opportunities.

I graduated from Lancaster University with a Masters in Mathematics in 2021, and over the past 2 years I have consistently delivered projects at Stanley Black & Decker, from Data Science to Digital Transformation.

I am experienced with Python and SQL, as well as mainstay business services like Power BI, Alteryx, Snowflake & Power Automate.
