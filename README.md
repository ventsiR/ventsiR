### [Portfolio](./Portfolio)

Graduated with a Master's Degree in Mathematics from [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/) in the UK in 2021, achieving First-Class Honours (equiv. 3.7-4.0 GPA). Specialized in probability theory (producing a [dissertation on random walk recurrence](./Portfolio/university/dissertation)), real & complex analysis and, outside of my degree, studied theoretical computer science.

### Skills

* Familiarity in driving global projects through their entire development life cycle
* Deep experience with data: interactive visualizitaions via Power BI, transformation with Alteryx, and automated pulling using SQL Snowflake, APIs & Power Automate
* Fluency with Python; implementing ad-hoc scraping, API & visualizatoin solutions using NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, BeautifulSoup & requests

* Background in a professional capacity to: write documentation for my projects post-deployment, conduct hand-over, on-board team members and lead casual workshops
* Understanding of low-level programming concepts, proficiency with C

### Learning

I am always learning; my mathematics degree being highly abstract, I like to explore more directly applicable fields like computer science, data, supply chain and factory operations.

I am currently taking Harvard's open [CS50x 2024](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) course to gain some standard practices and a cursory computer science understanding.
